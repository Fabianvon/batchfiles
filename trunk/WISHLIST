WISHLIST (no particular order)

o sweave.bat
  - make sweave.bat standalone -- currently it depends on Rterm.bat

o makepkg
  - allow flags/switches on makepkg.bat eliminating manually editing at top
  - allow one to specify a library on makepkg other than .\library

o testing on Windows XP
  - I only have access to Vista

o toogleDoc
  - eliminate perl dependence
  - make toggleDoc standalone
  - simplify installation so that it can be placed anywhere in path

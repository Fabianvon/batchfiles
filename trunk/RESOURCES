Information on building packages can be found in the Writing
Extensions Manual.    The following link is also useful although
the enclosed batch files eliminate the need for some of the 
procedures discussed:

Googling for

	creating making R packages

will find links to a number of privately written tutorials.
(I have not reviewed these.)

2. GENERAL RESOURCES

The Windows command line commands will bring up help information 
that is particularly useful:

	help set
	help for
	help if


batchfiles consists of a set of Windows XP (not tested on 
NT/2k) batch and javascript files which facilitate:

1. starting R, automatically locating it in the registry
   each time they are run, so that when a new version of 
   R is installed its not necessary to update them all 
   - Rcmd.bat, Rgui.bat, R.bat, jgr.bat

2. locating all R versions and optionally setting one in the
   registry - Rversions.bat, Rversions.hta

3. use of .Rbuildignore when checking and installing 
   R packages automatically running a build first and then 
   'Rcmd CHECK' or 'Rcmd INSTALL' in one step.  Also sets R_LIBS
   to .../R/library if R_LIBS has not already been set.
   - makepkgs.bat

4. locating various R tools that are used in building R packages
   on your system by querying the registry.
   - Rfind.bat

5. copying/moving libraries from one version of R to another.  This 
   is a temporary measure that will be eliminated once R 2.3.0 
   incorporates the expected replacement functionality in its installer.  
   - copydir.bat, movedir.bat

6. withgs.bat - temporarily adds ghostscript to your path (finding its
   path in the registry) and runs the command given as an argument.

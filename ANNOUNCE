A new version of the Windows batchfiles is available.  

CHANGES

Main change is the new R.bat utility which has a new interface and 
extended functionality assuming many of the other utilities which have
been removed as they are no longer needed.

Also there is a new Rpathset.bat utility similar in purpuose to: R.bat path. 

A new pdf document accompanies the utilties providing more detail.

OVERVIEW

These are self contained independent no-install Windows batch, javascript and 
.hta files.  Except for R.bat touch and R.bat SetReg they make no permanent
changes to your system.


R.bat

This utility is used to start R without having to set paths, enviornment
variables, set the registry, etc.  A number of associated functions are 
available as well.

R.bat locates R, MiKTeX, Rtools and then runs the command indicated by the
first argument.  

The first argument is the subcommand of which the following are available:
cd, cmd, dir, gui, help, path, R, script, show, SetReg, tools, touch.

Some examples are:

R gui -- run Rgui.exe
R CMD build mypkg -- build mypkg
R script myScript.R -- run Rscript.exe

R dir -- list directories with R installations
R help -- help info
R show -- show R_ variable values used (R_ROOT, R_HOME, R_VER, R_ARCH, etc.)

R path -- temporarily add R, MiKTeX and Rtools to the Windows path
R tools -- same but only MiKTeX and Rtools

Rpathset.bat

Rpathset.bat is a new command which is like 
  R path 
mentioned above except it lacks the automatic heuristic and relies on the 
user manually editing the set statements to indicate where various programs
lie.

Other

Other commands which continue to be available are copydir.bat, movedir.bat, 
el.js, clip2r.js and find-miktex.hta .  These copy and move R libraries,
run a command in elevated mode (i.e. as Administrator), copy the clipboard to
a running R instance and find MiKTeX.

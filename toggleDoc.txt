toggleDoc.pl
Perl script to reduce clutter in S4 html files and in S3 files
with many repetitive functions.
For an example of generated output, see
http://www.menne-biomed.de/download/toggleDoc/00Index.html

Put this script and the javascript file toggleDoc.js
into the Rxxx/library directory (you should also find the R.css file there).
When you run this script, new files 00IndexNew.html will be generated in
each directory.
***** Warning: this script has been tested under Windows only.
Please report required changes for Linux to
dieter.menne@menne-biomed.de


What it does:

Only 00Index.html files are changed by adding a javascript reference and a
checkbox to switch between the "Show All" mode and the short mode; the latter
is made the default on startup.
All references that have a "," are hidden in the short mode, e.g.

dperm,IndependenceTest-method

In addition, repetitive similar entries with a common target file are collapsed
to the first entry. For example, in R2HTML the following list only shows the
first HTML reference in short mode.

HTML              Outputs an object to a HTML file
HTML.anova.loglm  Outputs an object to a HTML file
HTML.aov 	        Outputs an object to a HTML file

The program does not touch files with the string "toggleDoc.js" in the
header, so if you want to protect single files from being processed, simply
add this string in a comment to the html file (but note that this will be
overridden anyway on the next update.)


The function has been tested with IE and Firefox 1.5 to 2.0.0.11
